**Actionable Insights for Brand Manager:**

*   **Increase Visibility:** Given the low engagement, consider promoting the video through relevant developer communities and social media channels.
*   **Showcase Value:** Focus marketing efforts on demonstrating the *benefits* of CodeX – how it makes programmers' lives easier – rather than just listing features.
*   **Visual Branding:**  Future videos should incorporate visual branding elements (logos, UI highlights) to increase brand recognition.
*   **Encourage Interaction:** Prompt viewers to ask questions or share their experiences with similar tools in the comments section.
*   **Monitor Sentiment:** Continue to monitor comment sentiment as the video gains traction to identify potential areas for improvement or address concerns.
